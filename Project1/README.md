# Practice Git Skills

## Directions

In this homework, you will practice using Git to put your code on GitHub. As stated in the student guidelines, make a branch off of master called "development" to do your work in.

For each previous project:

1. Download your previous project from Glitch.
1. Unzip your project into a new directory.
1. Move your project directory into this repository.
1. Commit your project code.

Each project should be in a separate commit.

When done, make a pull request from development to master to submit your homework.

### Git Immersion

After you have completed putting your previous projects on GitHub, go to [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/). You should walk through these exercises before Monday. When it asks you to install Ruby, run `brew install ruby`.
